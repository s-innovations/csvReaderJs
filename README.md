# csvReaderJs
A demonstration project for working with Typescript/Requirejs in Visual Studio

The project is made to show off some of the tooling support we are getting in Visual Studio for Grunt,Bowser and NPM. The project is a template for working with Typescript AMD Modules using RequireJs as the module loader. 

The project shows how one can work with large( even though the library is small) javascript libraries in visual studio using Typescript.
